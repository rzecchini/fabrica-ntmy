fabrica-ntmy
============

This is the representation of data I collected about people who work at Fabrica. It started as my trial project at the Urban Codes Studio and it is the result of different thoughts and considerations before starting my trial period.

This is a first attempt to make a visualization of the Fabrica network and everyone who is interested in can contribute to develop this tool.
